## 🧠 Problem Statement / Business Objective

> “Automate the classification of various legal documents.”

Legal professionals at J.P. Morgan spend over **360,000 hours annually** reviewing commercial loan agreements. This is time-consuming and error-prone. The goal is to use analytics and machine learning to **automate the classification of legal documents** and **reduce manual workload** while improving accuracy.

---

## 🎯 Business Goals

- Automate clause classification in legal documents.
- Reduce manual labor and review time.
- Improve accuracy and reduce loan-servicing mistakes.
- Extend automation to more complex documents (e.g., credit-default swaps, custody agreements).

---

## 🎓 Learning Outcome

Convert a business problem into an analytical problem and break it down using the **CRISP-DM** framework.

---

## 📈 CRISP-DM Process Overview

The project follows the **CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining)** methodology, consisting of six phases:

### 1. 🏢 Business Understanding

- Define the problem: automate classification of legal clauses.
- Understand the current manual workflow and the need for automation.
- Determine success criteria: reduced review time, increased classification accuracy.

---

### 2. 📂 Data Understanding

- **Data Collection:** Gather a wide variety of legal documents (loan agreements, filings, etc.).
- **Data Description:** Understand document structure, metadata, and relevant features.
- **Data Exploration:** Analyze document types, missing values, class imbalance.
- **Data Quality:** Clean for duplicates, typos, and inconsistencies to ensure high data reliability.

---

### 3. 🧹 Data Preparation

- **Cleaning & Transformation:** Remove duplicates, handle missing values, standardize legal text.
- **Integration & Selection:** Merge documents into a structured dataset, select features useful for classification (clauses, keywords, entities, etc.).
- **Note:** This is typically the most time-consuming phase.

---

### 4. 🤖 Modeling

- **Model Selection:** Choose machine learning techniques suitable for text classification.
  - Natural Language Processing (NLP)
  - Deep Learning Models
  - COIN (Contract Intelligence) – J.P. Morgan's proprietary AI tool
- **Model Training:**
  - Train the model on labeled legal documents.
  - Use techniques such as tokenization, word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, BERT), and neural networks.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate model performance on validation sets using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

---

### 5. 📊 Evaluation

- **Evaluate Results:** Ensure the model meets business goals with real-world documents.
- **Review Process:** Revisit earlier stages if the model fails to perform adequately.
- **Feedback Loop:** Refine the model based on evaluation findings and repeat the training if necessary.

---

### 6. 🚀 Deployment

- **Deployment Planning:** Ensure scalability and integration into the existing legal review system.
- **Monitoring:** Set up alerts and analytics dashboards to monitor performance over time.
- **Final Checks:** Validate the final system, confirm alignment with business goals, and push to production.

---

## ✅ Conclusion

This project demonstrates how **data analytics** and **machine learning** can be used to solve a real-world business challenge—**automating legal document review**. Through the application of the **CRISP-DM framework**, the complex problem was broken into manageable phases. The successful deployment of a tool like **COIN** illustrates how labor-intensive manual tasks can be transformed with AI, enhancing both speed and accuracy.
